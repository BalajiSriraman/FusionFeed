Python Inheritance
Like any other OOP languages, Python also supports the concept of class inheritance.

Inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class.

The new class that is created is known as subclass (child or derived class) and the existing class from which the child class is derived is known as superclass (parent or base class).

Python Inheritance Syntax
Here's the syntax of the inheritance in Python,



The User class remains an abstract base class with an abstract method get_user_name.

The UserAuthenticator class now inherits from the User class and overrides the get_user_name method, which is no longer an abstract method. It also includes the find_user method.

The AuthValidation class is unchanged and continues to use the User class and its subclasses to provide the same functionality.

This code exclusively uses inheritance while maintaining the original functionality.
