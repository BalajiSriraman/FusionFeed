Explaination 
It seems like you want to implement the concept of interfaces in your Python code. Python doesn't have built-in support for interfaces like some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., Java), but you can achieve similar functionality using abstract base classes (ABC) and the abc module.

Here's how you can refactor your code to incorporate the concept of interfaces:

Create an abstract base class (interface) for your classes that should implement specific methods.
python
Copy code
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class DocumentInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_document(self, name, email, password):
        pass

class BlogPostInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create_post(self, title, content, author):
        pass

class AuthValidationInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def validate(self, email, password):
        pass
Modify your classes to implement these interfaces. Ensure that they provide concrete implementations for the defined methods.
python
Copy code
class Document(DocumentInterface):
    def create_document(self, name, email, password):
        # Your implementation here
        pass

class BlogPost(BlogPostInterface):
    def create_post(self, title, content, author):
        # Your implementation here
        pass

class AuthValidation(AuthValidationInterface):
    def validate(self, email, password):
        # Your implementation here
        pass
Update the methods in your Flask application to use these interfaces:
python
Copy code
# Route for creating a new user
@app.route('/signup', methods=['POST'])
def create_document():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        name = data.get('name')
        email = data.get('email')
        password = data.get('password')

        if not (name and email and password):
            return jsonify({'error': 'Missing data'}), 400

        # Create an instance of the Document class
        new_doc = Document()
        new_doc.create_document(name, email, password)

        # The rest of your code
        # ...

# Route for creating a new blog post
@app.route('/blog-post', methods=['POST'])
def create_post():
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        email = request.headers.get('email')
        password = request.headers.get('password')

        if not (email and password):
            return jsonify({'error': 'Missing email or password headers'}), 400

        # Check if the email and password match with the ones stored in the database
        auth_validation = AuthValidation()
        doc_data = auth_validation.validate(email, password)

        # The rest of your code
        # ...

# ...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
By defining interfaces using abstract base classes and implementing them in your classes, you ensure that the classes adhere to the contract specified by the interface. This promotes code organization and helps you maintain a clear structure in your application.
