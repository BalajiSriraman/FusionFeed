Explaination 

In object-oriented programming (OOP), an interface is a concept used to define a contract or set of rules that a class must adhere to. It specifies a set of methods that a class implementing the interface must provide, without specifying the actual implementation of those methods. The purpose of an interface is to ensure that classes that implement it provide specific functionality, which allows for standardization and code interoperability.

Interfaces are used in various programming languages, including Java and C++, to achieve abstraction and create a common framework for classes. They are particularly useful in the following ways:

Abstraction: Interfaces allow you to define a common set of methods that different classes must implement. This abstraction helps in hiding the implementation details and focusing on what an object can do rather than how it does it.

Polymorphism: Interfaces enable polymorphism, which allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same interface. This means that you can work with different objects in a generic way, as long as they adhere to the same interface.

-------------------------------------------
It seems like you want to implement the concept of interfaces in your Python code. Python doesn't have built-in support for interfaces like some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., Java), but you can achieve similar functionality using abstract base classes (ABC) and the abc module.


In this code, you have defined an abstract base class User with an abstract method get_user_name. UserAuthenticator is a concrete class that inherits from User and provides an implementation of the get_user_name method. This demonstrates the concept of interface in Python, although Python doesn't have a formal "interface" keyword like Java or C++.

The abstract base class (User) serves as an interface in this context. It defines the method that must be implemented by any class inheriting from it. UserAuthenticator follows this contract by implementing the get_user_name method. It ensures that any class inheriting from User will have a get_user_name method.

By defining interfaces using abstract base classes and implementing them in your classes, you ensure that the classes adhere to the contract specified by the interface. This promotes code organization and helps you maintain a clear structure in your application.
