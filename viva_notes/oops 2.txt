Array of Objects:

An array of objects is a collection or list where each element in the array is an instance of a class (an object). In the context of OOP, it allows you to manage multiple instances of entities with similar properties and behaviors efficiently.

In the code, an array of objects is created to store instances of the BLog class.

This array makes it easy to manage and manipulate Blog data within your application.




Static is a keyword in C++ used to give special characteristics to an element. 

Static variable in functions
Static Class Objects
Static member Variable in class
Static Methods in class

And they have a scope till the program runs

Class or Static Variables in Python

In Python programming, a static variable is said to be a class variable that is common to all class members. 

the @staticmethod decorator is used to define the Validate method as a static method within the AuthValidation class. 

in our case 

This allows you to call the Validate method without creating an instance of the AuthValidation class, making it a convenient way to perform authentication checks against a MongoDB database.


Features of Static Variables
Static variables are allocated memory once when the object for the class is created for the first time.
Static variables are created outside of methods but inside a class
Static variables can be accessed through a class but not directly with an instance.
Static variables behavior doesn’t change for every object.

Static Methods:

Static methods are methods that are associated with the class itself, rather than with instances of the class. They do not have access to instance-specific data

Static Constants (Class Constants):

Static constants, also known as class constants, are values that are associated with the class itself and remain constant across all instances of the class.



The Python approach is simple; it doesn’t require a static keyword.
